# Coursera AI for Medicine Specialization by deeplearning.ai
Medical Images processing

## Week 1 : Learning Objective
+ Data pre-processing: checking for data leakage
+ Preprocess images properly for the train, validation and test sets
+ Implement a weighted loss function to address class imbalance.
+ Set up a pre-trained neural network to make disease predictions on chest x-rays.

## Week 2 : Learning Objective
+ Calculate true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.
+ Calculate sensitivity and specificity
+ Calculate Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).
+ Understand confidence intervals, ROC curve, and F1 score.

## Week 2 : Learning Objective
+ Perform image segmentation on 3D MRI data.
+ Take random sub-samples from a 3D image.
+ Standardize an input image.
+ Apply a pre-trained U-Net model.
+ Implement a proper loss function for model training (soft dice loss).
+ Evaluate model performance by calculating sensitivity and specificity.
